            ## Documentation

            The slides are saved as markdown in `/docs`. 
            They use [Marp](https://marp.app) to convert the `.md` files into html.
            You can configure **vscode** to preview the slides as well. 

            ## Code examples

            The code examples are saved in `/src/client/apps/code`.
            Dive into these examples code to get a "real world" grasp
            of the tipocs we're talking about during the lessons.
            I'll do my best to keep them updated. ðŸ¤“
        
            ## Exercises

            The exercises are saved in `/src/client/apps/exercise`.
            This is where you come into play: I'll publish reasonable challenges
            here that you can take over in your spare time. 
            Everything is already setup. 
            
            Run this platform in dev mode:

            ```
            yarn build --watch      # watch for client code changes
            yarn serve:lambda       # spin the netlify functions local server
            yarn serve              # spin the dev server
            # or
            yarn dev                # run all the above in parallel
            ```

            And follow the instructions in the exercise description page.

            ### Pro tip

            This platform uses [bulma.io](https://bulma.io/) css framework 
            under the hood. If you want to speedup your style development and
            focus on js/ts coding, give it a read.
