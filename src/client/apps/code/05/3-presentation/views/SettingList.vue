        <h5>Settings... not really ðŸ¤“</h5>
        <p>
            Sorry, but there are really no settings here.
            This is more of an example of routing/store usage.
        </p>

            You can use this views to implement your version of settings though.
            The more you try and code, the more you learn and grow.
